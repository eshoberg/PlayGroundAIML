#ChatGPT Poem of Love and Combinatorics
>[2023.02.02]

## ---|| Write a poem about Love using Combinatorics as the theme.  
~~~    
Love, a mathematical game,    
Where hearts and souls play a different name.  
With numbers and variables at play,  
Our emotions find a perfect sway.  
  
Combinatorics, a subject of art,  
A delicate dance between heart and part.  
With permutations and combinations too,  
Our love becomes a complex view.  
  
Each moment a unique arrangement,  
With love, trust and affection's arrangement.  
Our feelings a beautiful set,  
Together, forever, we won't forget.  
  
Like prime numbers, our love is rare,  
With each new day, a reason to care.  
The coefficients of our emotions,  
A bond that will last through all commotions.  
  
So let us cherish this mathematical love,  
With combinatorics as our guiding dove.  
For with each new moment and every breath,  
Our love becomes a beautiful mathematical set.  
~~~    
## ---|| Reverse the sentiment and use an applicable mathematical set.

Love, a mathematical ploy,  
Where hearts and souls are nothing but a toy.  
With equations and functions at play,  
Our emotions fade away.  
  
Combinatorics, a subject of logic,  
A cold calculation, nothing but a magic trick.  
With sets and relations in sight,  
Our love becomes a meaningless sight.  
  
Each moment a repeated pattern,  
With love, trust, and affection's demolition.  
Our feelings a monotonous set,  
Separated, forever, we won't regret.  
  
Like null sets, our love is rare,  
With each new day, a reason to repair.  
The absence of our emotions,  
A void that will last through all commotions.  
  
So let us abandon this mathematical love,  
With combinatorics as our guiding glove.    
For with each new moment and every breath,  
Our love becomes a meaningless mathematical set.
