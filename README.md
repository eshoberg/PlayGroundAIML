If you have forgotten your sudo password for Linux Ubuntu running on Windows WSL, you can reset it by following these steps:

1. Open the terminal on your Ubuntu WSL installation.

2. Type the following command to open the sudoers file in the nano text editor:
```
sudo visudo
```
This command will open the sudoers file, which controls access to the sudo command.

3. In the sudoers file, look for the following line:
```
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
This line grants the sudo privileges to users who are members of the sudo group. 

4. Add the following line beneath it:
```
yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
Replace "yourusername" with your actual username.

5. Save and exit the sudoers file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.

6. Close the terminal and reopen it.

7. You should now be able to run sudo commands without entering a password.

Note: Be sure to remove the line you added in step 4 once you've reset your password. Leaving it in place can create a security risk.

Hello, this is Bing. I'm sorry to hear that you have forgotten your sudo password for Linux Ubuntu running on Windows WSL.üòû

According to one of the search results[^1^][1], you can reset your password by following these steps:

- Open your command prompt from Windows by typing cmd on search.
- Type `ubuntu config --default-user root` to set root as the default user for Linux Bash Shell.
- Open the Linux Bash shell which will log you in as root without asking for password.
- Use `passwd username` to reset the password of any user.

I hope this helps.üëç

If you have forgotten your sudo password for Linux Ubuntu running on Windows WSL, you can reset it by following these steps:

1. Open a Windows PowerShell window as an administrator.
2. Run the following command to boot into recovery mode:

```
wsl.exe -u Ubuntu -i -s recovery

```

4. Run the following command to reset your password:

passwd
```

5. Enter your new password and confirm it.
